%%% Graphical User Interface for the chemical shift distributions and  %%%
%%% Secondary structure analysis
%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%% To do GUI:
% - correlationg chemical shifts with torsion angles (Ramachandran + TALOS)
% - extract statistics from PDB, BMRB ecc
% - import spectra from topspin as a plotting background for our stats
% - keep an eye if we can correlate and implement MD data, like SKETCHMAP
% - 


%% Chemshift to Do

% load pdf (or topspin data) for the spectrum in the loop and plot chem shift stats on the spectrum

% improve legend

% extend code capabilities, plot other stats and simulate spectral
% expectations

% machine learn a feature extraction for peak maxima (see ARTINA) and compute parameters
% like RMSD between experiments and simulations on top of the shift predictions
